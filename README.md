# Aim: To study and implement C++ Arrays and Strings

# Theory:

Array:

An array stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.



# 1. Algorithm for "Reverse Number Using Arrays.cpp"
Purpose: To input numbers into an array and display them in reverse order.

Algorithm:

Start

Declare an integer a to store the size of the array.

Prompt the user to enter the array size.

Read the value of a.

Declare an integer array Num[10].

Prompt the user to enter a number of values.

Loop from i = 0 to i < a:

Input Num[i]

Print "Reversed Array is:"

Loop from j = a - 1 to j >= 0:

Print Num[j]

End

# 2. Algorithm for "Print Subject marks using Array.cpp"
Purpose: To input marks of subjects and display them.

Algorithm:

Start

Declare an integer array marks[100], and variables n and i

Prompt the user to enter the number of subjects

Read value into n

Prompt the user to enter the marks

Loop from i = 0 to i < n:

Input marks[i]

Print "The Marks Are:"

Loop from i = 0 to i < n:

Print marks[i]

End
